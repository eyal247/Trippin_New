# trippin-android-app

trippin' is a native Android app for global travelling. Users can plan their trips around the world based trips that other
users have made and documented in the app. This way, users can customize and personalize their trip based on chosen
attributes of their next travel.

For example, let's say you are a couple, looking to go to Brazil and explore its beautiful beaches. You are 25-35 years old
and want your trip to have a romantic nature. No problem! trippin' will show you similar trips with similar attributes so that
you can plan your perfect trip.

The interaction with the app is made with google maps, which makes familiar and easy to find new places in your destination.
On the Google map, you can view similar trips created by others and add the places you like to your own trip map. You can also
search and add places to your trip map using our Google Places based search bar, or even add new places that nobody have heard
of using a long click on your trip map.

PLAN your trips, DOCUMENT them by uploading notes and pictures to each place you visit, and SHARE it with our community through
your trip settings.
